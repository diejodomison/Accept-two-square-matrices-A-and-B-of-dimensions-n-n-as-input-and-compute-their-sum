# Accept-two-square-matrices-A-and-B-of-dimensions-n-n-as-input-and-compute-their-sum

The first line will contain the integer n. This is followed by 2n lines. Each of the first n lines is a sequence of comma-separated integers that denotes one row of the matrix A. Each of the last n lines is a sequence of comma-separated integers that denotes one row of the matrix B.

Your output should again be a sequence of n lines, where each line is a sequence of comma-separated integer that denotes a row of the matrix A+B.
